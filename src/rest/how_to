as of writing this my understanding of how to make this work for my situation is basically:
swagger.yml has to be updated with all the different names and such
people.py has to be updated to pull data from the sql server instead of using a hard coded set of data
both files need to be updated with the added complexity of multiple files and the different amount of columns
